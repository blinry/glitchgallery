I was attempting to create a node that would repeatedly save the last 100 positions of a given function, traced out in green dots here. Unfortunately, instead of saving into the very last spot in the array, it saved into the second-to-last spot in the array, creating an interesting gap and teleporting lines whenever a new position was saved. It's always a shame when your creations accidentally learn to artistically teleport.
