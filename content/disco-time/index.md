This was the result of a [force directed graph drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing) algorithm. Nodes are initially placed randomly and spring-like forces are computed between each pair of nodes. To minimize these forces, nodes are moved, which often results in a cleaner graph picture. When moving the nodes, Fiona forgot to clean old edges that had been drawn, and just added new edges, resulting in series of similarly positioned lines of the same color.

[Here's](https://twitter.com/sicarius/status/402430028928913409) the intended, final result.
